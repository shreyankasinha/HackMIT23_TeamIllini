## Inspiration

"HomeworkWise: For Students, By Students" was conceived as a solution to a series of pressing challenges that beleaguered the traditional approach to homework assignments in collegiate settings. The three core challenges were:

1. **Academic Dishonesty:** The widespread issue of students copying assignments verbatim diminished the efficacy of assignments as a learning tool.

2. **Assessment Limitations:** Conventional platforms failed to adequately assess students' mastery of the content, as multiple submission attempts often blurred the line between genuine comprehension and sheer chance.

3. **Demotivation due to Single Submission:** The imposition of a single submission attempt, while curtailing dishonesty, often left students disheartened due to the punitive nature of point deductions.

## Our Approach

To address these challenges, HomeworkWise employs a multifaceted approach:

1. **Randomized Question Selection:** Questions are randomly drawn from an extensive question bank stored as a JSON file. This randomization discourages plagiarism as the likelihood of encountering the same question diminishes significantly.

2. **Streak-Based Scoring:** HomeworkWise introduces a streak system. The longer a student maintains a correct response streak, the more points they accrue for each subsequent correct answer. This gamified element encourages sustained engagement and rewards consistent understanding.

3. **Dynamic Difficulty Levels:** The platform dynamically adjusts question difficulty levels based on student performance. Successive correct answers elevate the challenge level, while multiple incorrect responses prompt a reduction in difficulty. This adaptive approach prevents student demotivation.

## Benefits

The benefits of HomeworkWise are multifold:

1. **Accurate Assessment:** Professors gain the ability to assess whether students are genuinely mastering the course material, addressing the issue of superficial learning.

2. **Time Efficiency:** Students who possess a solid grasp of the content can complete assignments more swiftly, optimizing their study time.

3. **Reduced Anxiety:** By promoting a supportive learning environment and reducing the punitive aspects of homework, HomeworkWise mitigates homework-related anxiety.

## Technicalities

HomeworkWise leverages advanced technologies, including unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms, to ascertain question difficulty levels and categorize them accordingly. The platform employs a versatile technology stack encompassing MongoDB, JSON, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to facilitate seamless functionality.

## Challenges

One notable challenge encountered during development pertained to the absence of an existing question bank paired with accuracy rate data. To circumvent this challenge during the prototype phase, a decision was made to create a question bank consisting of elementary mathematics questions, with randomized accuracy rates assigned for demonstrative purposes.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Looking ahead, our aspirations for HomeworkWise encompass the incorporation of a professor-driven question creation system. This enhancement will feature predictive algorithms to estimate question accuracy rates, thus mitigating the "cold start" problem associated with new questions. Our trajectory is one marked by continuous refinement and expansion, ensuring that HomeworkWise remains an indispensable asset for students and educators alike in their quest for enhanced academic achievement and pedagogical effectiveness.
